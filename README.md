### Intro
We do value Clean Code and hope that you do too.

**_Refactor_** the app to make its code clean. While doing so try to also apply,
where applicable, design principles and patterns known to you. They may be
SOLID, GRASP patterns, Design Patterns, etc. Whatever will make the code
easier to change, test, and understand.

### About the app
Our friend wants to organize a Foosball tournament at her work, but there are many
single players who need a teammate. While preparing a lunch she wrote a simple
app that will help her to organize the tournament. Unfortunately, she got stuck
due too messy code and asks you, the real programmer, for help. Make the code
great again and the tournament reality!

In the kitchen we've found a cookbook with some notes on margins about the app:

>Currently all the teams are created randomly. It's fine, but sometimes it would
 be good to pair players to have all the teams on similar level of strength. Therefore
 an attacker would be paired with defender or those who can play on both positions. Of
 course, those who are comfortable on both positions can play with each other in
 a team. Two defenders or two attackers are weaker than other combinations, so should
 be paired this way only when there are no other options.
